# T3 Code Mobile

> [!NOTE]
> To install the released app from the App Store or Google Play, see [Mobile app](../../docs/user/install.md#mobile-app). This guide covers building it from source.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Uses native modules so using Expo Go is not supported. You need to use the Expo Dev Client.

This app has three variants:

- `development`: Expo dev client, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Dev`
- `preview`: persistent internal preview build, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Preview`
- `production`: store/release build as `T3 Code`

Run commands from `apps/mobile`.

T3 Connect is optional and disabled in a fresh clone. Public configuration belongs in the
repository-root `.env` or `.env.local`, not an `apps/mobile/.env` file. See
[`../../.env.example`](../../.env.example).

## Development

For simulator, emulator, or Android phone development, boot or connect a device, then install the
native client that matches this checkout before starting Metro:

```bash
vp run mobile:install ios [simulator-udid]
# Or: vp run mobile:install android [emulator-or-phone-serial]
vp run dev:client
```

The device argument can be omitted when exactly one device is booted or connected. The helper
compares this checkout's Expo fingerprint and the installed binary with its last install record,
and reuses a matching client. Otherwise it installs the build for that fingerprint from
`~/.cache/t3code/native-clients/artifacts`, then the shared task cache, and builds only when
neither has it. A build runs in the `Mobile Dev Client` workflow (Blacksmith runners with warm
Gradle and ccache state, and a macOS runner for iOS) when `gh` may dispatch workflows on
`pingdotgg/t3code` and HEAD is pushed; the helper waits for the client in the shared cache.
Otherwise, or when HEAD lacks your native edits or `T3_NATIVE_CLIENT_BUILD=local` is set, it builds
on this machine. Main's client is built there on every native change, so most checkouts hit. One iOS simulator build serves every iPhone and iPad simulator, and one APK per
ABI (x86_64 or arm64-v8a) serves every emulator and phone of that ABI. Build output goes to the
log file it prints (`T3_NATIVE_CLIENT_VERBOSE=1` streams it instead). Builds are shared back when
your task-cache login (`bash infra/task-cache/install.sh`) can write. `T3_NATIVE_CLIENT_CACHE=read`
skips the upload and `off` skips the shared cache. Physical iPhones still use `vp run ios:dev`.

`--session <name>` installs into an agent-device session opened elsewhere, such as a device pool
or a cloud simulator, instead of a local device: `vp run mobile:install android --session pool-1
--metro http://<this-machine>:8081`. It uses only the cached build (x86_64 by default; `--abi`
for ARM) and fails with the next step when no machine has built this fingerprint yet.

For a read-only decision, run `node ../../scripts/mobile-native-client.ts check <ios|android>
[device]`: exit 0 means compatible, 2 means an install is needed, and 1 means an operational error.
An externally installed client is unverified until the helper installs it once.

Start Metro for an already verified dev client:

```bash
vp run dev:client
```

Metro keeps its transform cache between ordinary starts. If the cache itself is causing stale or
invalid output, clear it for one development-client start:

```bash
vp run dev:client:reset
```

Run that reset once after installing or changing the Uniwind dependency patch. Cached transforms
can otherwise reference its previous pnpm package path. Ordinary Metro starts still keep the cache.

Component edits use Fast Refresh. See [mobile development lifecycle](../../docs/internals/mobile-development.md)
before changing runtime ownership or refresh behavior.

Build and run the local iOS dev client:

```bash
vp run ios:dev
```

After changing a native dependency patch, rerun CocoaPods before rebuilding an existing iOS
project. pnpm gives each patch hash a new package path; Pods can otherwise keep compiling the
previous directory.

If your Xcode account only has a Personal Team, use a bundle identifier you control and opt into the
reduced-capability local build. Personal Team builds omit the widget and share extensions, push
entitlement, and native Sign in with Apple entitlement; builds without this opt-in are unchanged.

```bash
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1 \
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.t3code.dev \
vp run ios:dev
```

Build and install a self-contained Release app that does not need Metro:

```bash
vp run ios:release
```

The Personal Team equivalent also needs a unique bundle identifier:

```bash
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM=1 \
T3CODE_IOS_PERSONAL_TEAM_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.t3code \
vp run ios:release
```

Build and run the local iOS preview app:

```bash
vp run ios:preview
```

Inspect the resolved Expo config for a variant:

```bash
vp run config:dev
vp run config:preview
```

Run static checks for mobile native code:

```bash
node ../../scripts/mobile-native-static-check.ts
```

The native lint task runs SwiftLint for Swift plus ktlint and detekt for Kotlin. Missing native tools are reported as warnings and skipped locally. CI installs the default toolset from `apps/mobile/Brewfile` before running the native checks.

## EAS Builds

Preview and production variants use Expo fingerprinting so OTA updates only reach binaries with matching native dependencies, config plugins, and patches. CI uses the `preview:dev` profile to reuse a compatible native build when possible.

The development variant uses `appVersion` to avoid recalculating the native fingerprint for each Metro launch manifest. `MOBILE_VERSION_POLICY` can override either default. If you distribute a custom Release build with the development identity and publish OTA updates to it, set `MOBILE_VERSION_POLICY=fingerprint` for both its build and updates. Changing the runtime policy requires a native rebuild for OTA matching; an existing dev client can still load local Metro bundles.

For preview or production EAS environments, set `T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
`T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`, and `T3CODE_RELAY_URL`
as EAS environment variables. Expo config maps the canonical values into the mobile build.

Create a PR preview dev-client build manually:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview:dev
```

Create a cloud dev-client build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:dev
```

Create a persistent preview build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview
```

Android equivalents:

```bash
vp run eas:android:dev
vp run eas:android:preview:dev
vp run eas:android:preview
```

## Standalone Android fork with OTA updates

Create a project in your own Expo account. Set these public values in the root `.env`
and in that project's EAS `preview` environment:

```dotenv
APP_VARIANT=preview
T3CODE_MOBILE_EAS_OWNER=your-expo-username
T3CODE_MOBILE_EAS_SLUG=t3-code-fork
T3CODE_MOBILE_EAS_PROJECT_ID=your-expo-project-uuid
T3CODE_MOBILE_APP_NAME=T3 Code Fork
T3CODE_MOBILE_ANDROID_PACKAGE=com.t3tools.t3code.preview
T3CODE_MOBILE_SCHEME=t3code-fork
```

T3's production sign-in service authorizes the preview Android package above.
Keep that package when using the production Clerk instance; a custom package
requires registering its native application and OAuth callback in Clerk. The
preview package installs alongside the published production app, but cannot
coexist with another build using the preview package.

Also configure the T3 Connect public values described above in the EAS `preview`
environment. An installable APK can be built locally with
`vp run eas:android:preview:local`; the GitHub Release flow below builds and publishes it
from Fedora. This standalone app runs without Metro.

### GitHub Release APK updates

For Android voice input connected to a Windows PC, see the
[Windows host setup](../../docs/user/composer.md#android-transcription-with-a-windows-pc).
Both the host server and phone app must include this fork's transcription support.

The preview app can check the public GitHub Releases for a newer Android Preview APK
from **Settings → About T3 Code → Check for app updates**. It downloads the APK and
opens Android's package installer; Android asks the user to allow installs from T3 Code
the first time and asks for confirmation for each update. This is an APK update, not a
silent install. The first build containing this updater must still be installed once
manually. Reopen T3 Code after Android finishes installing the update.

Build and publish a release from a clean Fedora checkout after the source commit has
been pushed to the fork. The command builds on that machine and publishes the APK to
the public repository's Releases; it does not use GitHub Actions or an EAS cloud build
worker. EAS authentication is still used for the project and managed Android signing
credentials, and `gh` authentication is used to publish the public release. The APK is
publicly downloadable because the fork repository is public.

```bash
cd apps/mobile
eas login # or set EXPO_TOKEN
gh auth login
vp run release:android:preview
```

The Fedora machine needs Node.js, pnpm/Corepack, EAS CLI, GitHub CLI, and Android SDK
build-tools. Keep the Android package and signing key unchanged so Android accepts
each APK as an update. The `preview` EAS profile increments its Android `versionCode`;
the release script uses that code for the `android-preview-<versionCode>` tag.

The existing EAS Update channel remains available for JavaScript-only changes. Native
changes, including this updater and microphone permissions, need a new APK release.

Publish JavaScript and asset changes with:

```bash
vp run update:android:preview --message "Describe the fix"
```

The app checks for updates when it starts; a downloaded update
loads on a subsequent launch. Native changes require a new APK with the same signing
key. Keep builds and updates on the same host OS and package-manager version so their
native fingerprints match; do not send updates for this fork to the upstream Expo project.
